Here you can suggest a translation to image text.

Please check /Translated g00s for untranslated images. If it's not there, then it's not yet translated.
You may check /g00 pngs for already decompressed images.

If you have a different translation than the existing one, please add it on a new line.

Keep in mind that there's limited space for text in the image, so make the translation as short as possible.
Keep the translation consistent with scene script.
If these two don't agree, we can discuss it in the forum.

Current restriction:
- Text on ef_bg_name_cuting.g00 may not longer than 10em/15en
